        <h2>A bit about me and how I got into coding</h2>
        <p>I am currently completing a Software Developer Skills Bootcamp at <a href="https://thedeveloperacademy.com/" target="_blank"><strong>The Developer Academy </strong></a> as part of the April 2025 cohort. However, I am still relatively new to coding after learning the basics of web development at home for a few months prior to starting the course. I have a degree in Linguistics and after a brief career in teaching English as a second language, I worked as an Operations Specialist for a medical and security assistance company, helping people all over the world and saving lives for over a decade.</p>
        <p>Entering midlife, moving to Yorkshire and leaving my job in London in the space of a fortnight made me pause and think about what I would <em>really</em> like to do for a living going forward. My curiosity and passion for continuous learning, problem-solving and creating solutions that have real-world impact led me to explore the software development path and training opportunities. A career in tech, which seemed impossible at first, suddenly wasn't so impossible anymore. Soon I was hooked on Codewars, reading discussions on Stack Overflow and revising long-forgotten bits of the maths curriculum.</p>  
        <p>Solving problems and puzzles is great fun but what I enjoy the most is the creative process where I can use these bits of code to make something useful. To see what I have been working on recently, you can check out my projects <a href="projects.html" target="_blank"><strong>here</strong></a> or visit my <a href="https://github.com/EKomin220" target="_blank"><strong>GitHub</strong></a>.</p>
